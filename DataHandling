# Lil' cheatsheet for me during development

## File Handling
##### Move # of files in directory
``` mv `ls | head -500` ./newfolder```

##### Rename all files to their md5sum
``` for i in *; do sum=$(echo -n "$i"|md5sum); mv -- "$i" "${sum%% *}"; done ```


##### Rename all files according to their MIME using Exiftool
``` exiftool -ext '*' '-filename<%f.$fileTypeExtension' '/path/to/directory' ```
