#ML Malware Analysis - Dissertation

## Introduction

> The following repo is my University Dissertation, exploring ML techniques to identify / classify Binaries based upon their maliciousness using a point-scoring system.
>
>For example, 1 = Malicious 0 = Not Malicious 
>> If a Binary has FEATURE A, it is given a score of 0.6 (E.g. Virus Total)
>> If a Binary has FEATURES B, C, it is given 0.4 (E.g. Bitcoin addresses, IP Addresses, etc)

>> Families include Ransomwares, Trojans, Droppers, Keyloggers


>
## TODO
> Literally everything

## Installation

> PIP install and/or considering Jupyter Notebook release
