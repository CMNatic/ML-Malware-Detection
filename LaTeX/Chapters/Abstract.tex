The prevalent risk of malicious infection is an ever-increasing threat to the availability of World-wide Information Technology infrastructure, whom form as pillars to day-to-day society as we know it.

Presenting in many forms, Malware variants have a variety of common objectives from an attackerâ€™s perspective. One category known as Ransomware, is a variant of malicious code whom prohibits a User from accessing a system and/or its data until a ransom is paid - a modern twist on the traditional extortion schemes used by criminal syndicates.
This is an especially noticeable limitation in current methodologies for malignant detection, using signature-based detection, which uses pre-determined rule sets to identify code as malignant or not.

The following research project investigates and experiments with applying machine-learning models to be able to score the maliciousness of code within datasets based upon their heuristics, where the models have no prior-knowledge of the file presented.
